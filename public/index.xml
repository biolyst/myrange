      <description>Why Mismatch distributionsThe distribution of pairwise genetic difference (also referred to as mismatch distribution) is the distribution of the number of difference between pairs of haplotypes. It can be used to gain insight into demographic history. Populations at the demographic equilibrium threshold display multimodality. While populations lacking stability (recent expansion) display unimodality (Slatkin and Hudson 1991)- From some of my currently unpublished work

      <description>IntroductionInternet search volume and web page hits can provide interesting insights into the collective unconscious (read the minds of bored 20 - somethings on furlough)
This is nice quick introduction to two straight forward packages, googletrendsR and wikipediatrend.
There will also be a cursory flirt with Facebook’s Prophet, a forecasting package.
So lets call in our libraries
#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~options(scipen = 999)library(gtrendsR)library(tidyverse)library(ggcharts)library(ggsci)library(ggthemes)Google TrendsThe query requires a few different arguments which we can define before hand.</description>

      <description>IntroductionAs per application requirements I will be analysing the data set in accordance withprescribed guidelines.
There are three major points to adhere to:
div.grey { background-color:#3d4849; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;}Identify 3-5 interesting facts from the data setIdentify at least 3 of the errors within the data setExplain rationale and methodology via code chunks and prose.Tabset is incompatible with Hugo, so this is one LONG scroll.</description>

      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <title>(Hu)go Template Primer</title>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent Go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in Go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using Go templates.</description>

      <description>Step 1. Install Hugo Go to Hugo releases and download the appropriate version for your OS and architecture.
Save it somewhere specific as we will be using it in the next step.
More complete instructions are available at Install Hugo
Step 2. Build the Docs Hugo has its own example site which happens to also be the documentation site you are reading right now.
Follow the following steps:
 Clone the Hugo repository Go into the repo Run hugo in server mode and build the docs Open your browser to http://localhost:1313  Corresponding pseudo commands:</description>

      <title>Migrate to Hugo from Jekyll</title>
      <link>https://biolysthome.netlify.app/posts/migrate-from-jekyll/</link>

      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>
