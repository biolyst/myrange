<h2>Why Mismatch distributions</h2>
<hr />
<hr />
<hr />
<p><em>The distribution of pairwise genetic difference (also referred to as mismatch distribution) is the distribution of the number of difference between pairs of haplotypes. It can be used to gain insight into demographic history. Populations at the demographic equilibrium threshold display multimodality. While populations lacking stability (recent expansion) display unimodality (Slatkin and Hudson 1991)</em>

<h2>House Keeping</h2>
<p>Just a heads up,</p>
<p>I won’t be getting into the creation of a sequence alignment (that you would need to use to calculate Mismatch Distributions) or all the ramifications of and reasons for conducting such an analysis.</p>
<p>This has been created to work with <strong>DnaSP version 6.12.03</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT: I suggest creating a new folder for outputting your DnaSP .out files.</strong></p>
</div>
<div id="prepping-files" class="section level2">
<h2>Prepping Files</h2>
<p>Get your alignment opened up in DnaSp.</p>
<p>Select the <code>Analysis</code> tab and then click on <code>Population Size Changes</code>.
I left all settings as default and let it run, run times will vary depending on the size of your
alignment.</p>
<p>Once the run is complete</p>
<p>Go to <code>File</code> and choose <code>Save Current Output</code>.</p>
<p>Choose a folder that you can easily navigate to, or preferably within the RStudio project you
created.</p>
<p>What is really important is that you choose informative file names with a consistent format.
This is important and this will be used as titles in the plots later on.</p>
<ul>
<li>The format I like is : <code>Location_Species_Gene_NumberOfSamples</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever you do, make it informative and consistent. This is a good rule for file names in
general.</p>
<p><strong>You wouldn’t call your dogs, Dog1 and Dog2</strong></p>
<p>Do this for each of your alignments. This script gets all the more useful the more files you have.</p>
